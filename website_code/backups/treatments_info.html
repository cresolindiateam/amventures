                       All the benefits of microderm infusion + High Frequency.This is used to treat a variety of conditions, including acne management, enlarged pores, fine lines and wrinkles and puffy or dark eyes.During the high frequency 
                       treatment, enriched oxygen molecules are produced that create an anti-bacterial action and a "natural" thermal tissue warming. This reaction helps your blood vessels push away toxins, while the cells in your skin are enriched with nutrients and hydrating volume. This in turn creates an increase in blood circulation and cell renewal that supports increased levels of collagen and elastin. The skin is left feeling instantly energized and noticeably softer after just one treatment. *Recomended for acne clients*

After the enzyme masque mask kicks in a pulsating action occurs which is the “reverse osmosis” effect drawing toxins and fluids from your skin. During this time, the enzyme masque is also removing dead skin cells, 
                       activating collagen in the skin and working your facial muscles intensely, which leaves the skin feeling and looking incredibly firm.Enzyme Treatments act on the blood vessels by causing them to become dilated which allows a greater supply of oxygen rich blood to flow to the skin in order to nourish it.The back flushing action of the Enzyme treatments remove impurities and simulate the lymphatic system.

                       Enzyme Therapy treatments improve the skin’s ability to function by dissolving dead cells and impurities trapped within the skin. This in turn restores vital cellular nutrition and oxygenation required for cellular regeneration. Enzyme Therapy stimulates collagen production, restoring structural integrity back to the skin whilst being suitable for a wide range of conditions such as ageing skin, sun damage, acne, rosacea and pigmentation.

                       Microneedling works by encouraging your skin to make more collagen. The idea is that pinpricks from the procedure cause slight injury to the skin and that the skin responds by making new collagen-rich tissue. We use the only FDA approved microneedling pen to create these micro tears in the skin.Finishing with a soothing mask & LED light therapy to help with redness and inflamation.
